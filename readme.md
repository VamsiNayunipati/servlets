Design a HTML document that will display the following:
1.	A header that reads “Please enter your name”.
2.	Two text boxes with labels ‘First Name’ and ‘Last Name’. 
3.	Three radio buttons and a label “Gender” all in a single row. The labels for the radio buttons will be: “Male”, “Female” and “Other”.
4.	A button with text “Submit”.

Write a servlet program that will:
1.	When you enter a first name “John”, a last name “Doe”, click on the radio button “Male” and click on the button “Submit”, display a response on the webpage “Welcome to my shop” as a header and a message “Thank you Mr. John Doe.”
2.	When you enter a first name “Jane”, a last name “Doe”, click on the radio button “Female” and click on the button “Submit”, a response on the webpage will display “Welcome to my shop” as a header and a message “Thank you Ms. Jane Doe.”
3.	When you enter a first name “John”, a last name “Doe”, click on the radio button “Other” and click on the button “Submit”, a response on the webpage will display “Welcome to my shop” as a header and a message “Thank you John Doe.”
You should consider the following error cases where an appropriate error message should be displayed on the webpage:
1)	User doesn’t enter text for first name and last name.
2)	When either a first name or a last name is not entered and the user clicks on the “Submit” button.  
3)	When no radio button is checked and the user clicks on the “Submit” button.
